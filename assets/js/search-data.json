    "content": "Astrophotography is the practice of taking photographs of objects and phenomena in space, such as stars, galaxies, planets, and nebulas. It is a challenging and frustrating yet rewarding hobby that requires specialized equipment, skills, and techniques. Astrophotography involves using a camera mounted on a telescope or other astronomical instrument to capture images of celestial objects. These images can range from simple star fields to detailed pictures of distant galaxies, and can be taken using a wide variety of techniques and equipment. One of the most important factors in astrophotography is the quality of the equipment used. A good telescope or camera lens is essential for capturing sharp and detailed images, while a sturdy mount or tripod is needed to keep the camera steady during long exposures. In addition to equipment, astrophotography also requires specialized techniques for capturing and processing images. For example, long exposures are often used to capture faint objects in the night sky, and multiple exposures may be combined to create a single, high-quality image. ",

It is an important parameter to consider when setting up a camera and telescope for astrophotography, as it affects the focus and image quality. In order to achieve optimal focus, the back spacing needs to be carefully adjusted so that the imaging sensor is positioned at the correct distance from the telescope’s focal plane. This distance is determined by the optical design of the telescope and the camera being used. If the back spacing is too short or too long, the image may appear out of focus or distorted. To adjust the back spacing, various adapters and spacers may be used between the camera and the telescope. Some telescopes have a built-in focuser that allows for back spacing adjustments, while others may require external accessories. The optimal back spacing can be determined through trial and error or by using specialized software that analyzes the image quality. Back spacing is also important to consider when using accessories such as field flatteners or reducers, as these can affect the distance between the camera’s sensor and the telescope’s focal plane. Proper adjustment of the back spacing is crucial for obtaining sharp, high-quality astrophotographs. ",

    "content": "Bortle is a scale used to measure the darkness of the night sky at a particular location. It was created by John E. Bortle in 2001 and has become a widely used reference in astronomy and astrophotography. The Bortle scale ranges from 1 (the darkest sky) to 9 (the most light-polluted sky). The Bortle scale takes into account factors such as the visibility of stars, the Milky Way, and other celestial objects, as well as the amount of light pollution, skyglow, and artificial light sources present in the area. The Bortle scale is useful for astronomers and astrophotographers in choosing observing or imaging locations that offer optimal conditions for their purposes. For example, someone who wants to observe or photograph faint deep sky objects will likely want to choose a location with a low Bortle scale rating, while someone who is observing or photographing bright planets or the Moon may not need to worry as much about light pollution. Here’s a breakdown of the Bortle scale ratings and what they represent: . | Excellent dark sky: A sky that is completely free from light pollution, with the Milky Way visible from horizon to horizon and a wealth of deep sky objects visible to the naked eye. | Very good dark sky: A sky that is almost completely free from light pollution, with the Milky Way still visible from horizon to horizon and many deep sky objects visible to the naked eye. | Rural sky: A sky in a rural area with minimal light pollution, with the Milky Way still visible but not as bright or expansive as in a darker sky. Many deep sky objects are still visible to the naked eye. | Suburban sky: A sky in a suburban area with moderate light pollution, where the Milky Way is no longer visible to the naked eye and only the brightest deep sky objects are visible. | Bright suburban sky: A sky in a suburban area with significant light pollution, where only the brightest stars and deep sky objects are visible. | Suburban/urban transition: A sky in an area with a mixture of suburban and urban lighting, where the sky is noticeably bright and only the brightest stars and objects are visible. | Urban sky: A sky in a heavily light-polluted urban area, where only a handful of stars are visible and no deep sky objects are visible to the naked eye. | Inner-city sky: A sky in the heart of a major city with extremely high levels of light pollution, where no stars or deep sky objects are visible. | Bright inner-city sky: The brightest level of light pollution, found in areas with bright streetlights and other sources of artificial light, where the sky is indistinguishable from the city itself. | . It’s worth noting that the Bortle scale is not a perfect measure of observing conditions, and individual locations may vary in their sky quality even within a given Bortle rating. However, the scale does provide a useful framework for understanding and comparing different observing locations. A dark site is a location that has very low levels of light pollution, making it an ideal spot for stargazing and astrophotography. In the UK, dark sites are typically located far away from major cities and other sources of light pollution, in rural areas with few artificial lights. Some popular dark sites for stargazing and astrophotography in the UK include: . | Galloway Forest Park in Scotland: This park has been designated as a Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association, and offers some of the darkest skies in the UK. | Northumberland International Dark Sky Park: Another Dark Sky Park, this park in northern England offers stunning views of the Milky Way and other deep sky objects. | Exmoor National Park: This park in southwestern England has been designated as an International Dark Sky Reserve, and is home to some of the darkest skies in the country. | Snowdonia National Park: Located in Wales, this park offers some of the best dark skies in the UK, with excellent views of the Milky Way and other celestial objects. | Brecon Beacons National Park: Another Dark Sky Reserve, this park in Wales is home to some of the darkest skies in southern Britain. | . These are just a few examples of the many dark sites available for stargazing and astrophotography in the UK. It’s always a good idea to check local weather and sky conditions before heading out, and to be aware of any special regulations or restrictions in place at the location you plan to visit. ",

These frames include bias frames, dark frames, flat frames, and sometimes also offset frames. | Bias frames: Bias frames are images taken with the same camera settings as the astrophotography images but with a very short exposure time (usually less than one second). Bias frames capture the electronic noise present in the camera’s sensor and readout electronics. These frames are used to remove the bias noise from the astrophotography images. | Dark frames: Dark frames are images taken with the same camera settings as the astrophotography images but with the lens or telescope cap on, so no light reaches the camera sensor. The exposure time is typically the same as the astrophotography images. Dark frames capture the thermal noise generated by the camera’s sensor and electronics during an exposure. These frames are used to remove the thermal noise from the astrophotography images. | Flat frames: Flat frames are images taken with the same camera settings as the astrophotography images but with a uniform light source (such as a lightbox) illuminating the camera’s sensor. Flat frames capture the unevenness in the camera’s optics and dust particles on the camera’s sensor. These frames are used to correct for vignetting, dust motes, and other optical defects in the astrophotography images. | Offset frames: Offset frames are similar to bias frames but with a longer exposure time (usually a few seconds). Offset frames capture the low-frequency variations in the electronic signal, such as the signal from the camera’s power supply. These frames are less commonly used in calibration but can be helpful in some cases. | . Calibration frames are typically taken before or after the astrophotography session and are used to process the raw data in specialized software such as DeepSkyStacker or PixInsight. By subtracting the noise captured in the calibration frames from the astrophotography images, astrophotographers can produce cleaner, more detailed images of celestial objects. ",

The Bayer filter consists of red, green, and blue color filters arranged in a specific pattern over the sensor’s pixels. In a raw image, each pixel only captures intensity values for one color channel (red, green, or blue) because of the presence of the color filter array. Demosaicing algorithms interpolate the missing color information for each pixel by utilizing the surrounding pixels with different color filters. By analyzing the patterns and relationships between neighboring pixels, the algorithm estimates the full-color values for each pixel. The demosaicing process helps generate a full-resolution, full-color image that can be further processed and manipulated. It is a crucial step in the overall image processing pipeline for producing accurate and visually appealing final images. Various demosaicing algorithms exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and different software applications or plugins offer different demosaicing options to suit the user’s preferences and specific image characteristics.

Dew heaters work by using a heating element, typically a thin strip or pad of resistive material, that is placed in contact with the optical surface. The heating element is connected to a power source, such as a battery or AC adapter, and is controlled by a thermostat or other temperature control system. By warming the surface of the optics, the dew heater raises the temperature of the optical elements slightly above the dew point, preventing moisture from condensing on the surface. This helps to maintain clear, sharp images and prolongs the life of the equipment. Dew heaters are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to fit different types of telescopes, cameras, and other optical equipment.

This movement is used to improve the final image quality by reducing the effects of fixed-pattern noise, hot pixels, and other imperfections that can occur in digital images. Dithering is most commonly used when taking multiple exposures of the same object, such as during a long imaging session. By dithering the telescope or camera between each exposure, the final image will have a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which can result in better detail and color accuracy. The amount and frequency of dithering can vary depending on factors such as the imaging equipment, the object being photographed, and the desired final image quality.

The resulting image has a higher resolution than the original sub-images and is able to reveal more details about the object being imaged.

This includes galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and other objects that are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Deep sky objects are a popular target for amateur astronomers and astrophotographers because they provide a glimpse into the vastness and complexity of the universe. Unlike planets and stars, which can be observed individually and in detail, deep sky objects require telescopes and long exposure times to capture their faint light. Examples of deep sky objects include the Andromeda Galaxy, the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades star cluster, and the Whirlpool Galaxy. They are typically categorized as emission, reflection, or dark nebulae, globular or open clusters, or galaxies based on their structure, composition, and location in the sky. Deep sky objects are generally classified as emission or reflection. The main difference between an emission and a reflection lies in how they produce visible light. Emission nebulae are clouds of ionized gas that emit light at specific wavelengths as a result of high-energy photons from nearby stars. These nebulae appear reddish, pinkish or bluish in color depending on the specific gases present, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Examples of emission nebulae include the Orion Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. On the other hand, reflection nebulae are clouds of dust and gas that do not produce their own light, but instead reflect the light of nearby stars. They typically appear as bluish-gray or silvery-white regions against a dark background. The bluish color is due to the scattering of blue light by the dust grains in the nebula. Examples of reflection nebulae include the Pleiades star cluster and the Horsehead Nebula. Both emission and reflection nebulae are commonly observed and imaged in astrophotography, and both can provide important clues about the structure and composition of the universe. ",

    "title": "Equatorial Mount",
    "content": "An equatorial mount is a type of telescope mount used in astronomy that is designed to follow the apparent motion of the stars in the sky caused by the rotation of the Earth. It consists of two perpendicular axes: the right ascension (RA) axis, which points towards the celestial pole and moves in a circle around it, and the declination (Dec) axis, which is perpendicular to the RA axis and moves up and down along it. The RA axis of the mount is usually aligned with the celestial pole, allowing the telescope to track stars as they appear to move across the sky due to the Earth’s rotation. By using an equatorial mount, an observer can keep a celestial object in the field of view of the telescope for long periods of time, allowing for extended observations or astrophotography. Equatorial mounts can be manually operated or motorized, with the latter often being preferred for long-exposure astrophotography. Some mounts also include features such as computerized GoTo systems, which can automatically locate and track celestial objects based on input from a computer or hand controller. Equatorial mounts come in various sizes and designs to accommodate different telescopes and setups. They are commonly used for astrophotography, especially for deep-sky imaging where long exposure times are necessary. However, they can also be used for visual observation of celestial objects. A different kind of mount that you may encounter is an Alt-Az mount, short for Altitude-Azimuth mount. This is a type of telescope mount used in astronomy that moves the telescope along two perpendicular axes, one for altitude and one for azimuth. The altitude axis tilts the telescope up and down, while the azimuth axis rotates it side to side. Unlike an equatorial mount, an Alt-Az mount does not have a fixed orientation with respect to the celestial sphere, and thus does not track the apparent motion of the stars. Instead, it moves the telescope directly to the desired position in the sky, which makes it easier to use for visual observing and shorter exposures for astrophotography. Alt-Az mounts are often used for observations of the moon, planets, and other objects that move relatively quickly across the sky. Alt-Az mounts come in various sizes and designs to accommodate different telescopes and setups. They are often simpler and less expensive than equatorial mounts, making them a popular choice for beginners and for portable telescopes that are easy to transport. However, they are not useful for long-exposure astrophotography of deep-sky objects, which require the more precise tracking provided by an equatorial mount. Some Alt-Az mounts (specifically the Az-Gti) allow loading alternative firmware to convert them to an Equatorial mount with the addition of a cheap Equatorial wedge. ",

    "content": "The Skywatcher Evoguide 50ED is a very capable imaging scope once paired with a field flattener. However, its focuser really lets it down. There’s a lot of backlash. You have to turn the focus ring at least 90 degrees when swapping from focus in to focus out or vice-versa. This is irritating to use manually and a potential show stopper for any auto-focus system. The focuser is just a mechanical device, so I thought I’d take it apart, see how it works, and try to improve it. The focuser itself consists of 3 parts. One part is attached to the scope and contains the focus threads and the linear slide mechanism . The second part is the actual focus ring. When focusing inwards, the lip inside the focus ring rides on the tip of the focus tube. Strangely, it doesn’t ride on the convenient bearing surface that appears to have been cut behind it . The third part is the outer flange. This screws into the focuser and together they provide a small channel in which the lip on the focus ring rides. If you look carefully, you can see a shoulder on the flange just below the threads. The height of this shoulder determines the size of the channel in which the lip will travel. The backlash problem is caused entirely by the difference in dimensions between the thickness of this lip and the channel in which it rides. So to improve backlash we have to tighten those tolerances. There’s several ways to do this. We could pack out the focus ring from behind or we can pack it out from the front. I chose the latter solution and I’ve managed to almost eliminate the backlash whilst still being easy to turn. To do this, I used a 0.1mm M37 shim. Unfortunately, the inner dimensions of an M37 shim don’t quite fit over the shoulder on the outer flange so I had to very carefully trim the inner dimension. This is obviously not an off-the-shelf solution but does prove that an improvement can be made in this area. ",

Telescopes, particularly those with fast focal ratios, can produce curved or distorted fields of view. This means that objects at the center of the image may be in focus, but those towards the edges may appear blurry or distorted. A field flattener is designed to correct for these distortions by flattening the field of view and providing a sharp, well-corrected image across the entire field. Field flatteners come in various designs and configurations, but generally consist of a lens or lens system that is placed in the light path between the telescope and the camera. They are typically used in conjunction with a camera and other accessories, such as a filter wheel or focuser. Field flatteners can be particularly useful when imaging wide-field views of the sky, such as with a camera lens or a small refractor telescope. By correcting for field curvature, they allow for sharp, distortion-free images of extended objects such as nebulae or galaxies. It’s important to note that not all telescopes require a field flattener, and the specific type of field flattener needed depends on the telescope’s design and the camera being used.

Filters are a useful tool in astrophotography to enhance or isolate specific wavelengths of light emitted or reflected by deep sky objects. By using filters, astrophotographers can improve the contrast and detail in their images, reduce light pollution, and emphasize certain features of their target object. Some of the most commonly used filters in astrophotography include: . | Light pollution filter - This type of filter is designed to block out light pollution from cities and other artificial light sources. It can help improve the contrast and clarity of deep sky objects in areas with high light pollution. | Narrowband filter - A narrowband filter blocks out most of the light in the visible spectrum, allowing only specific wavelengths of light emitted by certain gases, such as hydrogen alpha or oxygen III, to pass through. This can reveal hidden details in nebulae and other deep sky objects that emit light at those wavelengths. | UV/IR cut filter - This type of filter blocks out ultraviolet and infrared light that can cause problems in astrophotography, such as chromatic aberration, color shifts, and blurring. | Color filter - A color filter can be used to enhance or emphasize specific features of a deep sky object, such as the red or blue regions of a nebula or the different color stars in a cluster. | Infrared Pass filter - This type of filter allows only infrared light to pass through, blocking out visible and ultraviolet light. It can be useful for capturing images of certain deep sky objects that emit a lot of infrared radiation, such as galaxies and some planetary nebulae. | . The most useful filter(s) for astrophotography will depend on the specific object being imaged, the location of the observer, and the equipment being used. For example, a light pollution filter might be more useful for astrophotographers in urban areas, while a narrowband filter might be more useful for capturing details in emission nebulae from dark sky locations.

    "content": "Focal ratio, also known as the f-number, is a fundamental parameter in optics that describes the ratio of a lens or telescope’s focal length to its aperture (diameter). It is typically represented by the symbol “f/” followed by a number, such as f/4, f/8, etc. The focal ratio has a direct impact on the brightness and depth of field of an image. A lower f-number (wider aperture) allows more light to enter the system, which results in brighter images and a shallower depth of field. This is useful for low-light photography and astrophotography where shorter exposure times are desired. A higher f-number (smaller aperture) allows less light to enter the system, resulting in dimmer images but with a greater depth of field, which can be useful for landscape photography or other situations where a large depth of field is desired. In astrophotography, the focal ratio is an important consideration when selecting a telescope for imaging. Telescopes with fast focal ratios (low f-numbers) can produce brighter images in a shorter amount of time, but they may also exhibit more optical aberrations and require more precise collimation and focusing. Slower focal ratios (higher f-numbers) may produce dimmer images but with greater resolution and a wider field of view. The optimal focal ratio depends on the specific imaging goals and the characteristics of the telescope being used. ",

    "title": "Field of View",
    "content": "In astrophotography, the field of view refers to the extent of the sky that is visible in the captured image. It is determined by several factors such as the focal length of the telescope, the size of the camera sensor, and the pixel size of the sensor. The field of view is usually expressed in degrees, arcminutes or arcseconds. A wider field of view allows capturing a larger portion of the sky, which is useful for imaging large objects such as galaxies or nebulae. On the other hand, a narrower field of view can be used for imaging smaller objects such as planets and smaller planetary nebulae, with greater magnification and detail. It is affected by several parameters, including: . | Focal length: This is the distance between the lens and the focal point. The longer the focal length, the smaller the field of view. | Sensor size: The size of the camera sensor also affects the field of view. A larger sensor will capture more of the sky, resulting in a wider field of view. | Pixel size: The size of the pixels on the camera sensor also plays a role in determining the field of view. Smaller pixels allow for more detail, but can result in a narrower field of view. | Telescope or lens aperture: The size of the aperture determines how much light can be captured and affects the depth of field. Larger apertures allow for more light, but can also result in a narrower field of view. | Barlow lens or reducer: The use of a Barlow lens or reducer can affect the field of view by magnifying or decreasing the size of the image. | Mount type and tracking accuracy: The mount type and tracking accuracy affect the ability to capture a wide field of view over a longer exposure time. A stable mount with accurate tracking will allow for longer exposures and wider fields of view. | . ",

    "title": "Full Well Capacity",
    "content": "Full well capacity, also known as saturation capacity, is a measure of the maximum number of electrons that a pixel in an image sensor can hold before it becomes saturated. When the pixel is saturated, it cannot record any additional information, and the resulting image will appear clipped and overexposed. Full well capacity is an important characteristic of a camera or sensor, particularly in astrophotography where long exposure times and faint signals are often used. A larger full well capacity allows the sensor to capture a wider range of signal levels without saturation, which results in more accurate and detailed images. On the other hand, a smaller full well capacity limits the dynamic range of the camera, making it more difficult to capture both bright and faint objects in the same image. Full well capacity is typically measured in electrons, and can vary depending on the sensor technology and pixel size. It is important to consider the full well capacity when selecting a camera or sensor for astrophotography or other applications where high dynamic range and low noise are desired. ",

    "content": "System gain in a camera refers to the overall amplification of the signal from the sensor to produce a usable image. It is a measure of the camera’s sensitivity, and is typically expressed in units of electrons per analog-to-digital unit (e-/ADU). The system gain is determined by several factors, including the sensor’s quantum efficiency (QE), the camera’s read noise, and the analog-to-digital converter’s gain. Higher system gain means that the camera is more sensitive, but it also means that the image will be noisier. Conversely, lower system gain means that the camera is less sensitive, but the resulting image will be cleaner. The optimal system gain for a particular camera and imaging scenario depends on the characteristics of the camera, the telescope or lens being used, and the specific imaging targets. In astrophotography, finding the right balance between sensitivity and noise is critical to producing high-quality images. Some cameras offer a dual gain capability (LCG = low conversion gain and HCG = high conversion gain). The High Conversion Gain mode effectively gives a gain boost, by a multiplier (usually x2). Some cameras allow this mode to be selected explicitly whilst others enable it automatically depending on the chosen gain value. The following graphs were created by myself from data obtained from Sharcap Sensor Analysis tool. They show data from my SvBony sv505c and is remarkably similar to the advertised data. You can see the results of the HCG mode kicking in at 100 gain. . ",

In astrophotography, long exposure times are often used to capture detailed images of celestial objects, such as galaxies or nebulas. However, even small tracking errors in the mount can cause star trailing or other image artifacts that can degrade the quality of the final image. To address this issue, a guide camera is mounted on a secondary telescope or piggybacked on the primary telescope. The guide camera captures a small section of the sky near the primary imaging telescope’s field of view. The guide camera sends this information to guiding software, which analyzes the star positions and sends correction signals to the mount, allowing for precise tracking. Guide cameras are typically small, lightweight, and designed to work in low-light conditions. They may also include features such as high sensitivity, high resolution, and rapid readout times to provide accurate guiding corrections. Some guide cameras may also include built-in autoguiding software, simplifying the setup process for the user. My guide scope and cam are a bundled Altair Starwave.

    "content": "Guiding is a technique used in astrophotography to improve the accuracy of tracking celestial objects during long-exposure photography. It involves using a separate guiding camera to track a reference star and make small corrections to the mount’s position to keep the object being photographed centered in the camera’s field of view. When taking long-exposure images of celestial objects, even small tracking errors or vibrations in the telescope mount can cause the object to appear blurry or distorted in the final image. Guiding compensates for these errors by constantly monitoring the position of a reference star and sending corrections to the mount’s position in real-time. To guide, a separate guiding camera is attached to the telescope, typically pointing towards a region of the sky near the object being photographed. The camera captures a live view of the stars and selects a reference star that is close to the object being photographed. The guiding software then analyzes the position of the reference star and sends small corrections to the telescope mount to keep the object centered in the camera’s field of view. The guiding camera can be controlled manually or using specialized software, such as PHD2 or N.I.N.A. The software typically provides tools for calibrating the guiding camera, selecting a reference star, and adjusting the guiding settings to achieve optimal performance. Guiding is an essential technique for capturing high-quality images of celestial objects, particularly for objects with small apparent sizes, such as galaxies or nebulae. By using guiding to compensate for tracking errors, astrophotographers can capture longer exposures and produce clearer, more detailed images. Guiding can be communicated to your equipment through two different mechanisms - Pulse Guiding and ST4 . ST4 (also known as ST-4) guiding is a method of autoguiding that uses a direct physical connection between the guide camera and the mount’s hand controller. The ST4 cable connects the guide camera to the mount’s autoguider port, and the guiding commands are sent as electrical signals over this cable. The ST4 interface provides a simple and reliable way to send guiding corrections to the mount, and it is widely supported by guiding software and mounts. Pulse guiding, on the other hand, is a method of autoguiding that uses the mount’s pulse guiding capabilities to send guiding commands to the mount. Pulse guiding uses software to translate the guiding corrections from the guide camera into a series of pulses that are sent to the mount through the mount’s computerized control system. Pulse guiding is a more flexible approach than ST4 guiding, as it does not require a physical connection between the guide camera and the mount. However, pulse guiding can be more complex to set up and may require specific software and mount compatibility. In summary, ST4 guiding is a simple and reliable method that uses a direct physical connection between the guide camera and the mount’s hand controller, while pulse guiding is a more flexible method that uses the mount’s computerized control system to send guiding commands. Both methods can provide accurate guiding corrections and improve the quality of astrophotography. ",

It corresponds to the emission line of ionized hydrogen gas (H+) transitioning from the n = 3 energy level to the n = 2 energy level. The H-alpha line has a wavelength of approximately 656.3 nanometers or a frequency of about 4.57 x 10^14 hertz. In astrophotography and astronomy, H-alpha is of great interest because it is a prominent emission line in many astronomical objects, particularly in nebulae. Nebulae are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, and when these nebulae are ionized by nearby stars or other energetic processes, they emit light at specific wavelengths, including H-alpha. The H-alpha line is especially significant because it reveals the presence of ionized hydrogen, which is a common element in the universe. By capturing the H-alpha wavelength in astrophotography, astronomers can study and image a wide range of astronomical objects, such as emission nebulae, supernova remnants, and regions of star formation. H-alpha imaging allows astrophotographers to highlight and visualize the intricate structures and details within these objects. It can reveal features such as glowing hydrogen gas clouds, filaments, shockwaves, and regions of intense star formation. H-alpha images often exhibit a distinct red color due to the prevalence of this emission line in the observed objects. Furthermore, H-alpha imaging is also useful for capturing solar phenomena, including solar flares and prominences, as well as for studying the chromosphere layer of the Sun. In these cases, specialized solar filters and equipment are necessary to safely observe and image the Sun in H-alpha. Overall, H-alpha imaging provides valuable insights into the dynamics and composition of various astronomical objects, allowing astronomers to explore and understand the processes shaping our universe.

The actual focus ring hadn’t moved at all, but what had happened is that it had got colder outside. As it got colder, the materials in the scope had shrunk and hence focus had moved slightly. This is such a fast lens that focus is absolutely critical. I went out at midnight and refocussed.

    "content": "A narrowband filter is an optical filter used in astrophotography to isolate specific wavelengths of light emitted by certain astronomical objects. Unlike broad-spectrum filters that allow a wide range of wavelengths to pass through, narrowband filters are designed to transmit only a narrow range of wavelengths, typically associated with specific emission lines. Narrowband filters are particularly useful for imaging nebulae, as they can isolate the light emitted by ionized gases, such as hydrogen (H-alpha), oxygen (OIII), and sulfur (SII). These emission lines are commonly found in nebulae and represent specific transitions in the energy levels of the ionized atoms. By using narrowband filters, astrophotographers can capture and emphasize the details and structures of nebulae while minimizing the impact of light pollution and other unwanted sources of light. This is because narrowband filters selectively transmit the desired wavelengths while blocking other wavelengths, including those from artificial light sources or natural skyglow. Typically, narrowband filters are used in conjunction with monochrome cameras, as they allow for precise isolation of specific wavelengths for each color channel. By acquiring separate images with different narrowband filters, astrophotographers can later combine and assign specific colors to each emission line during the image processing stage, resulting in vibrant and detailed representations of nebulae. A duo band filter, also known as a dual-band filter or dual-bandpass filter, is an optical filter used in astrophotography to capture specific wavelengths of light emitted by certain astronomical objects. It is designed to transmit two narrow ranges of wavelengths simultaneously, allowing for the capture of multiple emission lines or features in a single exposure. Unlike narrowband filters that isolate a single emission line, duo band filters are designed to capture two specific emission lines simultaneously. For example, a popular duo band filter is the H-alpha and OIII filter combination. It allows the transmission of light at the wavelengths corresponding to hydrogen-alpha (H-alpha) and oxygen III (OIII) emission lines. These two emission lines are commonly found in many nebulae, and capturing them simultaneously can reveal unique and detailed information about the nebular structures and processes. Duo band filters are often used in astrophotography setups where color cameras or one-shot color (OSC) cameras are employed. They allow astrophotographers to capture detailed images of nebulae with a single exposure, providing the convenience of capturing multiple emission lines without the need for multiple filters or multiple exposures. By using duo band filters, astrophotographers can capture the distinct features and structures of nebulae associated with the selected emission lines, resulting in stunning and detailed images with enhanced contrast and depth.

    "title": "Pier",
    "content": "In astrophotography, a pier typically refers to a stable, fixed mount or platform that is used to support an equatorial mount and telescope. Piers are often constructed of sturdy materials such as steel, concrete, or wood, and are designed to provide a stable base for the telescope, minimizing vibration and movement during long exposures. Piers are often used in permanent or semi-permanent observatories, where they can be anchored to a solid foundation and remain in place for extended periods. However, they can also be used in portable setups, such as in backyard astrophotography, where a pier can be temporarily set up on a stable surface such as concrete or decking. Using a pier in astrophotography can have several benefits. The stable platform helps to minimize vibrations and movement, resulting in sharper and clearer images. Piers can also provide a consistent alignment for the equatorial mount, making it easier to polar align and track celestial objects accurately. Piers can be purchased pre-made or custom-built to suit specific telescopes and mounts. They may also include features such as leveling adjustments, cable management systems, and vibration isolation materials to further improve stability and image quality. You may also encounter the term “side of pier”. In astrophotography, “side of pier” refers to the position of an equatorial mount and telescope relative to the celestial meridian line. The meridian line is an imaginary line that runs directly overhead from north to south, passing through the zenith. The side of pier is determined by the position of the mount and telescope relative to this line. When an equatorial mount is set up and polar aligned properly, it will track celestial objects as they move across the sky along a path that is parallel to the celestial meridian. As an object crosses the meridian line, the mount will need to perform a meridian flip, which involves slewing the telescope to the other side of the mount. The side of pier refers to which side of the mount the telescope is on before and after the meridian flip. For example, if the telescope is on the east side of the mount before the meridian flip, it will be on the west side of the mount after the flip. This is known as the “east side of pier” or “west side of pier” respectively. The choice of which side of pier to start on will depend on factors such as the location of the object being imaged, the location of obstacles such as trees or buildings, and the preference of the astrophotographer. Knowing the side of pier is important when setting up an imaging session, as it can affect the placement of the guide camera and other equipment, as well as the sequencing of exposures and meridian flips. Some astrophotography software and tools, such as PHD2 and N.I.N.A., provide options to control the side of pier during imaging sessions. ",

It is usually measured in micrometers (µm) and can have a significant impact on the image quality and resolution of astrophotographs. A smaller pixel size generally allows for higher resolution images with more detail, but can also result in a lower signal-to-noise ratio due to smaller photon collecting areas. On the other hand, larger pixel sizes typically have lower resolution but higher sensitivity to light.

    "content": "Plate solving is a technique used in astrophotography and astronomy to accurately determine the position and orientation of a telescope or camera in the night sky. It involves analyzing an image of the sky, identifying the stars and other celestial objects in the image, and using this information to calculate the exact position and orientation of the telescope or camera. The process of plate solving is typically performed using specialized software such as ASTAP, PixInsight, or SkySafari, which can compare the star patterns in the image to a database of known stars and other objects. This allows the software to accurately determine the position and orientation of the telescope or camera, even if it was not initially set up precisely. One of the main advantages of plate solving is that it allows for precise alignment of the telescope or camera with the desired celestial object. This is particularly important for astrophotography, where even small errors in alignment can result in blurry or distorted images. Plate solving is also useful for finding and tracking specific celestial objects, as it allows the user to quickly and accurately point the telescope or camera at the desired target. It can also be used to correct for tracking errors, ensuring that the telescope or camera stays accurately aligned with the object throughout the exposure. Overall, plate solving is a powerful technique that is widely used in astrophotography and astronomy.

    "content": "Polar alignment is the process of aligning an equatorial mount telescope with the celestial pole, either the North Pole or South Pole depending on the observer’s location. The alignment ensures that the telescope’s mount is properly aligned with the rotation of the Earth, which is necessary for accurately tracking celestial objects during long-exposure astrophotography or visual observation. The Earth rotates on its axis, completing a full rotation every 24 hours. This rotation causes the stars and other celestial objects to appear to move across the sky in circular paths, centered around the celestial poles. To track these objects accurately, a telescope must be mounted on an equatorial mount, which is designed to rotate around an axis that is parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis. Polar alignment is important because it allows the telescope to track celestial objects accurately without the need for constant manual adjustments. If the alignment is not accurate, the telescope will not be able to track objects smoothly, and they will appear to drift across the field of view over time. This can result in blurry or elongated images in astrophotography and make visual observation challenging. The process of polar alignment can vary depending on the type of mount and the observer’s location. However, it typically involves pointing the telescope towards the celestial pole and adjusting the mount’s altitude and azimuth axis until they are aligned with the rotation axis of the Earth. This can be done using specialized tools or software, such as a polar scope or a polar alignment routine in a planetarium software. In summary, polar alignment is an essential step for anyone using an equatorial mount telescope for long-exposure astrophotography or visual observation. It allows for accurate tracking of celestial objects, resulting in clear, sharp images and improved observational experiences. ",

Refracting telescopes, reflecting telescopes, and catadioptric telescopes are all commonly used in astrophotography, as are camera lenses. The camera used for astrophotography is typically a specialized astronomical camera designed to capture low-light, long-exposure images of celestial objects. These cameras often have features such as high sensitivity and low noise, which are important for capturing detailed images of dim objects in the night sky. Some popular brands of astrophotography cameras include ZWO, QHY, and Atik. Together, the imaging scope and camera work in tandem to capture detailed, high-resolution images of celestial objects, such as galaxies, nebulas, and star clusters. Astrophotographers often use specialized software to process and enhance these images, creating stunning visual representations of the cosmos. My main scope is the Skywatcher Evoguide 50ED.

The SII emission line has a wavelength of approximately 672.4 nanometers or a frequency of about 4.46 x 10^14 hertz. In astrophotography and astronomy, SII emission is of great interest because it is a prominent emission line observed in certain nebulae. Nebulae are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, and when these nebulae are ionized, they emit light at specific wavelengths, including SII. The SII emission line is particularly useful for studying and imaging nebulae that contain ionized sulfur gas. These nebulae often exhibit strong SII emissions due to the presence of ionized sulfur atoms within their structures. SII imaging allows astrophotographers to capture the specific emissions from ionized sulfur, revealing distinct features and structures within these objects. By combining SII imaging with other narrowband filters, such as H-alpha and OIII, astrophotographers can create false-color images that highlight different emission lines and provide a comprehensive view of the nebula’s characteristics. Assigning different colors to each emission line allows for a more detailed understanding of the ionized gas distributions, shockwaves, and other phenomena occurring within the nebulae. SII imaging is particularly useful in capturing the details of emission nebulae, supernova remnants, and regions of active star formation where ionized sulfur gas is prevalent. It helps reveal the intricate structures, filamentary networks, and interactions between different elements within these objects, contributing to our understanding of the astrophysical processes at play in the universe.

Generally, your total integration time for all images should be in the region of 1 to 10 hours. The more data you gather, the more signal you can extract from the noise. The first step in extracting that data is to combine it all together along with your calibration frames. My stacking tool of choice is Deep Sky Stacker. I find this tool most flexible and capable.

Bias frames contain only the readout noise of the camera, dark frames contain the readout noise plus the thermal noise of the camera, and flat frames are used to correct for dust and vignetting. | Register your images: Deep Sky Stacker will now align and stack your light frames. To do this, click on the Register tab and select the appropriate settings for your images. You can also choose to use one of the calibration frames as a reference image for alignment. | After registration, I like to manually example each frame and discard those that show excessive star trails or other artifacts such as blur, clouds or excessive light pollution. It would not be unusual for me to discard 10% of frames . | Stack your images: Once your images are registered, click on the Stacking tab to stack your images. You can choose from a variety of stacking methods and adjust the settings to optimize the final result. Typically I’d choose Kappa-Sigma clipping method for my light frames. This will generally discard satellite trails from your light frames so that they don’t mess up your final stacked image. I’ll also turn on 2x drizzle which will extract a bit more detail from your data especially if you’re using dithering. | Save your final image: Once the stacking process is complete, you can save your final stacked image as a FITS or TIFF file ready for processing. | . It’s important to note that the quality of your final stacked image will depend on the quality of your individual frames and calibration frames, as well as the settings you choose in Deep Sky Stacker. You can also use Deep Sky Stacker to combine images taken on different nights. To do this, simply repeat the process documented above but select a different group tabs at the bottom of the screen. Each evening should be in a different group. You can also use this to group images taken with different settings on the same evening. For example if you decide to change the exposure time or the gain settings, put the resulting images into their own group. ",

    "content": "A tripod is a three-legged stand used to support a variety of equipment, including cameras, telescopes, and surveying instruments. The tripod is designed to provide a stable and level base for the equipment, allowing for precise positioning and stable operation. Tripods come in a variety of sizes and materials, ranging from small lightweight models suitable for handheld cameras to heavy-duty models capable of supporting large telescopes. The legs of the tripod are typically adjustable, allowing them to be extended or retracted to achieve the desired height and stability. The head of the tripod is designed to attach to the equipment being supported, and may include a variety of features such as a ball head or pan-tilt head for precise positioning and alignment. In addition to photography and astronomy, tripods are used in a variety of other applications, including surveying, construction, and video production. The use of a tripod can help to reduce camera shake or other unwanted movement, resulting in sharper images and more stable video footage. ",

    "doc": "UHC Filter",
    "title": "UHC Filter",
    "content": "A UHC (Ultra High Contrast) filter is an optical filter commonly used in astrophotography and visual observation of deep sky objects. It is designed to enhance the visibility and contrast of emission nebulae, particularly those that emit light in specific wavelengths. The primary purpose of a UHC filter is to selectively transmit specific emission lines while blocking other unwanted wavelengths of light, including light pollution and skyglow. It is designed to target the wavelengths associated with common emission lines found in nebulae, such as hydrogen-alpha (H-alpha), oxygen III (OIII), and hydrogen-beta (H-beta). By allowing these emission lines to pass through while suppressing the continuum and other noise, a UHC filter increases the contrast between the nebula and the background sky. This enhances the visibility and details of emission nebulae, making them stand out more prominently against the dark sky. UHC filters are particularly effective in light-polluted areas where the presence of artificial lights can hinder the observation and imaging of faint nebulae. They help to mitigate the negative effects of light pollution by selectively transmitting the desired wavelengths emitted by the nebulae and suppressing the unwanted background light. When used for astrophotography, a UHC filter can improve the quality and detail of images by reducing the impact of light pollution and enhancing the contrast of emission nebulae. It allows astrophotographers to capture more detailed images of nebulae and reveal intricate structures and features that would otherwise be difficult to observe in light-polluted skies. It’s important to note that while a UHC filter can be beneficial for observing and imaging emission nebulae, it may not be as effective for other types of deep sky objects, such as galaxies or star clusters, which do not emit specific emission lines. In those cases, different types of filters, such as broadband or narrowband filters, may be more suitable. A similar filter, a CLS (City Light Suppression) filter is an optical filter commonly used in astrophotography and visual observation of deep sky objects, particularly in areas with significant light pollution. Its primary function is to selectively block certain wavelengths of light, including those associated with common sources of light pollution, while allowing other desired wavelengths to pass through. The CLS filter is designed to block specific wavelengths of artificial light, such as those produced by streetlights and urban lighting, which contribute to light pollution. It helps to suppress the effects of light pollution and improve the visibility and contrast of deep sky objects, including nebulae, galaxies, and star clusters. The CLS filter typically reduces the transmission of light at wavelengths associated with sodium and mercury vapor lamps, which are commonly used in outdoor lighting. These lamps emit light in specific wavelengths, such as the yellow-orange sodium D-line (589.3 nanometers) and various mercury emission lines. By blocking these specific wavelengths, the CLS filter helps to darken the background sky and increase the contrast between deep sky objects and the light-polluted sky. It enables astrophotographers and observers to capture or observe these objects more effectively, even in areas with significant light pollution. It’s important to note that while a CLS filter can be beneficial in mitigating light pollution, it does not eliminate it entirely. The effectiveness of the filter may vary depending on the severity of the light pollution and the specific characteristics of the light sources in the area. In extremely light-polluted regions, additional measures such as imaging from a dark site or using narrowband filters may be necessary to achieve optimal results. Overall, the CLS filter is a useful tool for astrophotographers and observers who wish to enhance the visibility and contrast of deep sky objects while imaging or observing under light-polluted conditions.

    "doc": "Walking Noise",
    "title": "Walking Noise",
    "content": "Walking noise is a type of noise that can occur in astrophotography when capturing long-exposure images, particularly with unguided mounts. It is caused by slight movements or vibrations of the camera or telescope that occur during the exposure, leading to a slight shift in the position of the stars in the image. These shifts can cause the stars to appear elongated or misshapen, and can reduce the overall sharpness and quality of the image. Dithering is a technique used to reduce walking noise and other types of noise in astrophotography. By intentionally shifting the position of the camera slightly between each exposure, dithering helps to randomize the walking noise and other sources of noise, making it easier to separate the signal (the stars and other astronomical objects) from the noise. This can result in a cleaner, sharper image with better detail and contrast. Drizzling is another technique that can be used to enhance the resolution and detail of astrophotography images, particularly when dealing with small or faint objects. ",

    "doc": "Wedge",
    "title": "Wedge",
    "content": "A polar wedge is an accessory used in astronomy for mounting a telescope or a camera on an equatorial mount. It is designed to align the polar axis of the mount with the celestial pole, allowing for precise tracking of celestial objects as they move across the sky. The polar wedge is typically made of sturdy material such as aluminum or steel, and it has an adjustable base that allows it to be leveled and aligned with the celestial pole. The telescope or camera is then attached to the wedge, which is in turn attached to the equatorial mount. By using a polar wedge, the user can ensure that the mount’s polar axis is aligned with the Earth’s axis of rotation, allowing for accurate tracking of celestial objects as they move across the sky. This is particularly important for long-exposure astrophotography, where even small errors in tracking can result in blurry or distorted images. My polar wedge is a Skywatcher Star Adventurer wedge. This is a cheap wedge which is, quite honestly, barely adequate for the job. Specifically, the Dec clamping mechanism is not fit for purpose. However, I’ve come up with a fix for this which improves performance by a massive amount. Here’s the fixes that I’ve created. I’ve also documented them on Cloudy Nights . 1) Get a brass bush made, 14mm diameter, 6mm deep with a hole in the middle for an M6 bolt. I got mine made cheaply from a guy on ebay . 2) Dismantle your wedge . 3) Use a 4mm-20mm step drill to drill the hole out to 14mm. When you get to the 14mm cut, the step drill should now fit very conveniently into the hole on the opposite side &amp; also into the recess to allow for an accurate cut . 4) Put the brass bush in the hole . 5) Reassemble with the plastic washer on the opposite side to the brass bush. I’ve replaced the standard lever here with a new one from eBay because my original broke long ago . You might notice my washer is red. I actually made a new one using the plastic lid from a confectionary container and a 44mm hole-saw . Enjoy a better clamped wedge . ",

    "content": "A workflow for a typical evening would be as follows:- . | Set up tripod pointing north, ensure it’s level. Power everything up, remove lens caps, turn on dew heaters. Make sure that all clutches and focus locks are tight | Whilst standing next to your equipment, run remote desktop on your laptop to access your control centre | Run NINA. Connect your imaging camera, guider and mount | Run the polar alignment process | Check focus. Go to the imaging tab, set up a suitable exposure and gain so that you can see stars and start looping exposures. Check that focus is good by adjusting slightly and checking the HFR history graph. https://nighttime-imaging.eu/docs/master/site/quickstart/focusing/ | Now that everything is physically set up, you can go indoors | Use the sky atlas to choose your target, then select “set for framing assistant” | Go to the “Framing” tab. Click “Slew and Center”. Wait for NINA to instruct the scope to move and to fine tune via plate solving | Once this is done, you can click “determine rotation from camera” to see if your field of view is appropriate. If not, you can go and physically rotate your camera | Go to PHD2, start guiding | Go to sequencer tab and add a new imaging sequence by clicking the “+” button. Configure to take a number of frames of your chosen length (e.g. 60 secs) of type LIGHT. Make sure to enable dither every 1 or 2 frames | Go to imaging tab, make sure guiding is working well, and when you’re ready, start the sequence | . Everything should happen automatically now. However, I like to keep my eye on things on a regular basis. I also like to download frames throughout the evening and process them to check everything is ok so I don’t waste my time on junk data . Once you’re nearing the end of the evening, make sure to take dark and bias frames. You can use the flat wizard for this . ",
