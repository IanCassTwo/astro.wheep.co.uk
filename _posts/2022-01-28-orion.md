This was probably the best photo I got from my old equipment. I used an Az-Gti (unguided), an ancient DSLR zoom lens, a Raspberry Pi HQ camera, and a software workflow consisting of several Raspberry Pi running Kstars/Ekos. I had a lot of fun with this equipment but barely got any results worth showing. The most important thing is that I learnt a lot and decided it was worth investing in some better equipment.
