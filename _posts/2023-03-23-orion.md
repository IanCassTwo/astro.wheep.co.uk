title:  "Orion Nebula Revisited"
---
After I got my new lens, I was keen to take a pic of a known quantity so I could compare what I did previously. This was still unguided and stil using my Raspberry Pi camera, and still using the KStars/Ekos workflow running on Raspberry Pi. The only difference between this and my previous attempt was the lens. As you can see it's far from perfect but it is much sharper now. I will revisit at some point and see if I can improve again.
