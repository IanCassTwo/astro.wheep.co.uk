I was lucky enough to have a second clear night in a row and I intended to collect more photons from Pleiades but it hadn't risen when I started my session. So, I decided to image Andromeda Galaxy instead. I'd never got a satisfactory result from this target in the past so I thought I'd get a few hours on it. A few hours turned into 4hrs and I never did switch back to Pleiades. Andromeda is harder to process than it is to capture, and I'm not entirely sure I'm happy with the result, but it's a million times better than I've achieved in the past
