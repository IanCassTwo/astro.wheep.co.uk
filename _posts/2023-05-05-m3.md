I've never though of M3 as being a particularly exciting target. I mean, it's just a bundle of stars. However, I thought it would be a good test of focus, resolution, noise, gain, and FWC, so I gave it 30mins. After I processed it, I realized I've been wrong all this time. It's actually quite an interesting target and I'll be giving it some more attention at some point in future.
