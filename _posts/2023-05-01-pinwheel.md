This was my first attempt after moving from my old Raspberry Pi and Kstars/Ekos/Indi workflow to a small form factor PC and N.I.N.A. It was also my first attempt with my new scope, imaging camera and guide camera, so really it was all new to me. It was also an evening with a full moon so light pollution was really against me. However, I managed to get an hour or so of data and the end result wasn't bad. I might revisit this at some point.
