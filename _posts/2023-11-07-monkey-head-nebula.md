I noticed a target appear at the bottom of my garden that I've never seen before. It's the Monkey Head Nebula. It was quite an easy target so I caught a few hours on it for several nights until I gathered enough to give a clean image. I ended up combining narrowband data with RGB data taken with only an IR filter for this image. This improves both the star quality and the background noise massively.
