title:  "Crescent Nebula pt1"
---
It's a funny time of year for astrophotography. I can't really image anything in the west because of light polution. The moon and light pollution limit the south east. For me, the north through east is generally best but there's not much there at the moment. However, if I wait until midnight, Cygnus appears from behind a giant conifer tree at the bottom of my garden and is rich in nebula. So, I thought I'd give it a try. For this session, I stuck with an IR cut filter which may seem like an odd choice for a nebula, but I wanted to get a good baseline and some nice sharp stars. My plan is to mix in some Ha and OIII data using my duo-band filter during another session. So, this is part 1 with part 2 (or more) to follow.

I also spent some time calibrating the backlash in PHD2 for much better tracking and recovery from dithering. It's literally a 1000 times better now. I've also recently watched a video on how to configure Green Swamp Server for backlash compensation so I'm keen to try that during my next session to see if it does an even better job than PHD2.
