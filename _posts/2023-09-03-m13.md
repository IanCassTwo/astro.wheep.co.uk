Finally in early September, we have some visible sky. However, it wasn't perfect. There was lots of very high level fine cloud which made seeing pretty poor. In addition, the full moon is rising in the North East which makes my favourite piece of sky out of bounds for now. So, I decided to go back to basics and practice my focus & noise control on a boring star cluster. I've never actually taken an image of M13 before, but they're all pretty much the same. Anyway, given such poor conditions, I'm quite happy with the way it turned out.
