I'm on a roll now! Yet another clear night so I thought I'd pick a target that I could image immediately and get a good number of hours on without staying up too late. The two choices were Wizard Nebula or Pacman Nebula. Wizard rises a good 30mins before Pacman, so Wizard it is. I managed to get a good polar alignment and had good guiding on this, so I just let it rip for a few hours. I didn't get much OIII data (for some reason) so the image is mostly Ha which is why it's so red. I think I'll need a lot longer integration time if I want to collect more Ha data. Anyway, it looks good as-is so I'm happy
