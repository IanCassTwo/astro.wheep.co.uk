workflow: Skywatcher Evoguide 50ED with Starizona Flattener, SvBony SV220 filter, Risingcam IMX585, guided, 10.5hrs of data

It's been cloudy here in UK for weeks so I was lucky enough to get two clear nights in a row. I managed to get ~9.5hrs of data on Soul Nebula using my narrow band filter and 1hr RGB data with just a IR Cut filter. I've never imaged this target before so I wasn't sure what to expect. It looks like this nebula puts out mostly Ha which makes it appear very red. This was also the first time I've mixed RGB and narrowband data in the same image so I'm still perfecting my technique for doing this. I did noticed that the RGB data reduced the dark noise dramatically and made the stars look very much better.
