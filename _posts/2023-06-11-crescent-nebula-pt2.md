title:  "Crescent Nebula pt2"

I managed to get another hours worth of data on Crescent Nebula the other evening. It's definitely improved but I think this is going to need another 10 hours to do it justice. I plan on adding to this as time goes on, but I plan to try the North America Nebula on the next clear evening.
