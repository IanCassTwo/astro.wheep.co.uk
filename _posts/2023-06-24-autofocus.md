title:  "Autofocus pt1"
---
I've always been intrigued by the [MyFocuserPro2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinoascomfocuserpro2diy/) DIY focuser project and since I was suffering badly with temperature related focus creep in the last session, I decided that now is the time to do it. So, I reviewed the project PDF and decided on a MyFP2M-DRV variant. I downloaded the Gerber files and uploaded them to JLCPCB in Hong Kong. They took a few days to print and are now in the post to me. The total cost, including manufacturing the minimum order size of 5 pieces, testing, tax, customs duty, and delivery, is £3.68. I'll keep 2 and sell the others on. I've also got an Arduino Nano here along with a stepper driver. The stepper motor itself, a NEMA14 0.9° motor is also on its way from China. 

Once everything gets here, I'll document the build. In there meantime, here's a pic of a GT2 pulley for the Evoguide 50ED that my friend made for me on his resin 3d printer.
