We had our first clear night here in UK for months, and it turned out to be the clearest night I can remember in the past year! I was guiding at 0.6-0.8" and I was able to take 10min exposures with and indicated ~2.0 HFR in NINA. To complete this wonderful evening, the wind was very low, the temperature was around 0c and there was no moon. We had a slight hiccup for ~45mins to wait for some cloud to clear, but other than that it was a wonderful evening. But what should I target? I wanted to get a decent Rosette Nebula before it disappeared below the horizon and I managed to get a really good 5hrs of data, mostly consisting of 5min subs although I did get some 10min subs as well. I also got some Jellyfish Nebula which I will save for another day. Anyway, the results are below. This is processed entirely in Siril with a few curves tweaks in Gimp
