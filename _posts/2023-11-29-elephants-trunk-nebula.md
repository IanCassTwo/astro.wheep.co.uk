This is the Elephants Trunk Nebula. I decided I wanted to make an attempt at getting this nebula before it disappeard over the horizon for this year. I've tried this before (see below) without much luck so I thought I'd try it again. I was somewhat lucky in that the evening was amazingly clear with fantastic seeing. I was able to maintain 0.5" guiding on an Az-GTI for hours on end which is nothing short of miraculous. Most of the data that I got here was taken with 10min subs. I'm quite happy with the results although I'm not sure I've got the most of this data yet, so perhaps expect a reprocess at some point.
