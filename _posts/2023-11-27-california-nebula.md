This is the California Nebula. It's a massive emission nebula in the constellation of Perseus. I gathered this data on a clear night with almost an entire full moon. The data I acquired on this was almost entirely Ha data and the OIII was virtually non-existant so I didn't even bother to add it to the final image, hence the reason it's so red. Anyway, I think it looks ok for a first attempt.
