This is the Tadpoles Nebula, IC410. It's a star forming region in the constellation of Auriga. It's near to the Flaming Star Nebula, the Spider Nebula and the Fly Nebula. I imaged this over a week where the sky was reasonable clear but not perfect however very window. My guiding was not well at all. I think this is why it looks a little less sharp that I would like. Anyway, I'm reasonably happy with it for now.
