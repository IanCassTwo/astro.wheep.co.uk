I managed to get the guiding working REAL well and the sky was clear, so I let it rip on the North America Nebula for about 3hrs whilst I got on with some coding. I noticed that it started to go slightly off focus towards the end of the evening so even more reason for me to complete this auto-focus project. Anyway, I'm happy with the framing but it needs much more data to get rid of the noise.
