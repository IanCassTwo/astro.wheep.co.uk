I decided to revisit the Whirlpool Galaxy M51 and gather some more data. In the process, I learnt how to stack images from different sessions in Deep Sky Stacker. I also improved my Siril processing techniques. I think there's still more to come from this galaxy so I'll revisit again at some point and show further updates.
