workflow: Skywatcher Evoguide 50ED with Starizona Flattener, sv220 narrowband filter, Risingcam IMX585 in HDR mode, guided, ~5hrs of data

I was lucky to get 3 clear nights here in UK. Again, guiding was going very well, so I spent two nights gathering narrowband data and one night grabbing RGB. I discovered that my sv220 filter can't deal with Alnitak! That star is BRIGHT! Anyway, it's nothing I can't fix with the addition of some RGB star data. Anyway, I'm relatively pleased with this image and I'll probably spend weeks "tweaking" it.
