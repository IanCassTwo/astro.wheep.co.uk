I finally had a clear night to test my new camera and it did not disappoint. This is the best, least noisy image I've taken yet. I chose Eastern Veil nebula because I'd taken that before so I could compare it directly to my old camera. I plan to make this the first panel in an 8 panel mosaic to try to get the entire Cygnus loop, if I get enough sky!
