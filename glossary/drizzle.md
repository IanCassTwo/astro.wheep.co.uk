Drizzle is a technique used in astrophotography to increase the resolution of images taken by telescopes or other instruments. It works by taking multiple sub-images of an object and then combining them in a way that preserves the finer details of the object. The technique was originally developed by NASA to enhance images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, but has since been adapted for use by amateur astronomers.

The process of drizzling involves taking each sub-image and breaking it up into smaller pieces called "pixels." The software then analyzes the pixels in each sub-image and uses a mathematical algorithm to determine how to combine them with the pixels from the other sub-images. The resulting image has a higher resolution than the original sub-images and is able to reveal more details about the object being imaged.

Drizzle is particularly useful for imaging objects that are very small or faint, or that have intricate structures. However, the process can be time-consuming and requires a significant amount of processing power, so it may not be suitable for all types of astrophotography.
