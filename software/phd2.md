PHD2 (Push Here Dummy 2) is a free and open-source software program used for autoguiding in astrophotography. It is widely used by amateur astronomers and astrophotographers to track celestial objects and capture long-exposure images with high accuracy.

PHD2 analyzes the movement of stars in the field of view and sends corrections to the mount, which adjusts its position to keep the object centered in the image. The program supports a variety of guiding methods, including adaptive optics, and can communicate with a range of telescopes and cameras.

PHD2 also provides advanced features such as drift alignment, which helps users align their telescope with the celestial pole for more accurate tracking, and multi-star guiding, which can improve guiding accuracy in crowded fields of stars. The program's user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.

PHD2 is compatible with a wide range of telescope mounts and cameras, making it a versatile tool for astrophotographers. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and can be downloaded for free from the official PHD2 website. The program is constantly updated and maintained by a dedicated team of developers, ensuring its continued functionality and usefulness to the astrophotography community.
