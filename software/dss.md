DeepSkyStacker (DSS) is a free and open-source software program used for astrophotography image stacking and processing. It was developed by a French astrophotographer named Luc Coiffier and is widely used by both amateur and professional astronomers worldwide.

DSS is designed to help photographers create high-quality, noise-free images of deep-sky objects such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters. It works by combining multiple individual frames of the same object into a single image, effectively reducing the noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio.

DSS supports a wide range of file formats, including FITS, RAW, and JPEG, and can be used with a variety of astronomy equipment, including cameras, telescopes, and mount controllers. It includes advanced features such as star detection, alignment, and weighting, as well as image normalization and calibration.

One of the unique features of DSS is its ability to handle large datasets, making it ideal for processing large numbers of frames from multiple imaging sessions. It can also perform batch processing, allowing users to stack and process multiple images automatically.

DSS also includes a range of image processing tools, such as histogram equalization, color adjustment, and noise reduction. It also supports advanced features such as compositing and image registration, allowing users to create high-quality, detailed images of deep-sky objects.

Overall, DeepSkyStacker is a powerful and versatile software program that is highly regarded by astrophotographers worldwide. Its user-friendly interface, advanced features, and ability to handle large datasets make it an ideal choice for anyone looking to create high-quality deep-sky images.
