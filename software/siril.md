Siril is a free and open-source software program used for processing astronomical images, particularly astrophotography images. It is widely used by amateur astronomers and astrophotographers to process and enhance images of celestial objects.

Siril provides a range of tools for image processing and analysis, including stacking, alignment, and calibration. It supports a variety of image formats and can handle both raw and processed images. Siril also includes advanced features such as deconvolution and wavelet processing, which can be used to enhance fine details in astronomical images.

In addition to its image processing tools, Siril also provides support for astrometry, which is the measurement of the positions and motions of celestial objects. The program can perform plate solving, which is the process of matching stars in an image to a known celestial coordinate system, allowing users to identify and track celestial objects with high accuracy.

Siril is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and can be downloaded for free from the official Siril website. The program is constantly updated and maintained by a dedicated team of developers, ensuring its continued functionality and usefulness to the astrophotography community.
