Windows Remote Desktop is a feature built into the Microsoft Windows operating system that allows users to remotely connect to another computer over a network connection. With Remote Desktop, users can access and control another computer as if they were sitting in front of it, allowing them to run applications, access files, and perform other tasks on the remote computer.

To use Remote Desktop, both computers must have the Remote Desktop feature enabled and be connected to the same network. The user can then initiate a Remote Desktop session by entering the name or IP address of the remote computer, and providing their login credentials.

Remote Desktop supports a range of features, including the ability to transfer files between the local and remote computers, redirect local resources such as printers and USB devices to the remote computer, and support for multiple remote sessions.

Remote Desktop can be a useful tool for a variety of purposes, such as providing remote technical support, accessing files or applications on a home or work computer while away from the office, or running applications on a remote server. However, it's important to ensure that Remote Desktop connections are secured and configured properly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
