## About

I've been taking pictures of the night sky for a few years now. This hobby started for me when I won a prize at work which gave me some virtual cash to spend in a corporate shop. Of all the things to buy, a telescope caught my attention. To be honest, it wasn't very good but it inspired me to learn more about the night sky. It was at this point I decided I wanted to combine my photography hobby with my new astronomy hobby. The next thing I purchased was a motorized mount and a polar wedge. The next year or so was spent learning about workflows and techniques using the cheapest equipment I could find (Raspberry Pi, RPI HQ Camera, old DSLR lenses). I figure I'd learn more from poor equipment rather than just throwing money at the problem. Anyway, at the beginning of 2023, I won another prize and used it to fund some better equipment. Since then, I feel I've made some real progress into getting good results. This website is to try to share some of my knowledge.
