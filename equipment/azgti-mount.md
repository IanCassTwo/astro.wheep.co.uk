The Skywatcher AZ-GTi is a compact and portable alt-azimuth mount designed for astrophotography and visual observing. It can support small to medium-sized telescopes or camera equipment, making it a popular choice for those who want a mount that is easy to transport and set up.

The AZ-GTi mount features a built-in WiFi module and can be controlled wirelessly using the free SynScan app for iOS and Android devices. The app allows you to align the mount with the night sky using your smartphone or tablet, and then control the movement of the mount and the attached equipment. The app also includes a database of over 10,000 celestial objects for easy object locating and tracking.

The AZ-GTi mount has a payload capacity of up to 5 kg (11 lbs) and can track celestial objects with smooth and accurate movement using its DC servo motors. The mount also includes an ST-4 autoguider port for precise guiding during long-exposure astrophotography.

The AZ-GTi mount can be powered using a 12V DC power supply or by eight AA batteries (not included), making it a versatile option for use in the field or at a dark sky site. It also includes a built-in bubble level and adjustable altitude and azimuth controls for easy setup and alignment. Overall, the Skywatcher AZ-GTi mount is a great option for those looking for a portable and easy-to-use mount for astrophotography and visual observing.

The Skywatcher AZ-GTi is an alt-azimuth mount, which means that it is designed to move the telescope or camera equipment in altitude (up and down) and azimuth (side to side) axes. However, with the addition of an equatorial wedge, the AZ-GTi mount can be converted to an equatorial mount.

An equatorial wedge is an accessory that attaches to the top of the AZ-GTi mount and allows it to tilt to match the angle of the Earth's rotational axis. This adjustment effectively turns the mount into an equatorial mount, which is designed to track objects in the night sky as they appear to move across the sky due to the Earth's rotation.

With an equatorial wedge attached, the AZ-GTi mount can be polar aligned and used for long-exposure astrophotography of deep sky objects. However, it is important to note that the AZ-GTi mount has a relatively low weight capacity, so it is best suited for use with small to medium-sized telescopes or camera equipment.
