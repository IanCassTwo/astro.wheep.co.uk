A main imaging scope and camera are key components in astrophotography. The imaging scope is the telescope or lens used to gather light from celestial objects, and the camera is used to capture and record that light as digital images.

The type of imaging scope used in astrophotography can vary depending on the specific objects being imaged and the desired field of view. Refracting telescopes, reflecting telescopes, and catadioptric telescopes are all commonly used in astrophotography, as are camera lenses.

The camera used for astrophotography is typically a specialized astronomical camera designed to capture low-light, long-exposure images of celestial objects. These cameras often have features such as high sensitivity and low noise, which are important for capturing detailed images of dim objects in the night sky. Some popular brands of astrophotography cameras include ZWO, QHY, and Atik.

Together, the imaging scope and camera work in tandem to capture detailed, high-resolution images of celestial objects, such as galaxies, nebulas, and star clusters. Astrophotographers often use specialized software to process and enhance these images, creating stunning visual representations of the cosmos.

My main scope is the Skywatcher Evoguide 50ED. This is a refracting telescope designed for astrophotography. It has a 50mm (2-inch) aperture and a focal length of 242mm, giving it a focal ratio of f/4.8. It's primarily designed as a guide scope however has Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass in the objective lens. This helps to reduce chromatic aberration, which is a common problem with refracting telescopes that can cause color fringing and reduce image sharpness. The use of ED glass in the Skywatcher 50ED allows for clearer and sharper views of celestial objects and, with the addition of a Starizona field flattener, makes a brilliant main imaging scope. 

I use an SvBony SV505C as my main astrophotography camera. This is a 12-bit one-shot colour camera with good sensitivity and a larger than normal sensor based on the Sony IMX464.
