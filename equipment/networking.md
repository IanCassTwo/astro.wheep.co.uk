I use a Homeplug network adapter to link my equipment to my home network. HomePlug networking is a technology that allows users to extend their home network by using existing electrical wiring as a network connection. This technology is commonly used to provide a wired network connection to areas of the home where Wi-Fi signal is weak or unreliable.

HomePlug devices consist of two adapters that plug into electrical outlets: one adapter is connected to the router or modem, and the other adapter is connected to the device that needs to be connected to the network. These adapters communicate with each other over the electrical wiring in the home, creating a wired network connection between the two devices.

HomePlug technology has several advantages over other networking technologies, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables. It is easy to set up, as users only need to plug in the adapters and they will automatically connect to each other. It is also very stable, as it is not affected by interference from other wireless devices or physical obstacles that can block Wi-Fi signals.

One downside of HomePlug networking is that it may not work well in homes with old or poorly maintained electrical wiring, as the quality of the electrical wiring can affect the performance of the network. Additionally, the speed of the network connection may be slower than traditional wired or wireless networking solutions, although newer versions of the technology have significantly increased speeds. Luckily, Remote Desktop does not need much bandwidth so even poor performance is adequate.
