I use a Lenovo M73 small form factor PC as my main control centre. This is an Intel based PC running Microsoft Windows and is located on the tripod itself where it can be plugged directly into the equipment. I can access it remotely via Windows Remote Desktop over a Homeplug powerline network adapter. It runs NINA, GS Server, PHD2 and ASTAP. 

All images are copied onto my main PC for processing.

Here's a video on Youtube where Cuiv shows you how to set up your PC.
